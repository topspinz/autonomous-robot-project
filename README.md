# Autonomous-Robot-Project
Basically building an autonomous robot that will make use of a wide rage of sensors that will enable it to run on its own.
IR Dection - This project folder allows a robot to follow a black line on the floor.
Edge Dectection - you may place the robot on any table or counter top and the robot will not fall off the edges due to the use of infared sensors detecting the edges
Obstacle Avoidnce- With the use of sonar sensors, infared sensors, and proximety sensors the robot its able to move around an area avoiding all forms of objects while still staying in motion

A rough video of The Edge Detection Robot I apologize shakiness
